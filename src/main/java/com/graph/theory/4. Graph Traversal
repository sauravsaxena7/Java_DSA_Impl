* To get or reached all nodes
* Traversal



BFS [Breadth First Search or Level Order traversing]
 - equidistance nodes basis traversal = BFS
 - Iterative approach

Rahul-> Source node

Rahul starting node
X=> 1 distance
Y=> 1 distance
Z=> 1 distance
A=> 1 distance

rahul friends girlfriend and failed to make girlfriend
X'=> 2 distance
Y'=> 2 distance
Z'=> 2 distance
A'=> 2 distance


rahul friends girlfriend friend
P => 3 distance

source node => 1 distance => 2 distance => 3 distance

This type of traversal is called BFS [ Breadth First Search ]



DFS [Depth First Search]
 - Direction Based
 - Recursive approach

Rahul -> X1  -> X2 => failed to find girlfriend
Rahul -> Q -> Q1 => failed to find girlfriend

Traversing into depth of nodes

* Directed Graph => A--------->B, A connected to B only but B is not Connected to A.
  - Direction of arrow is important, it is singly direction from one not to another node

* Un-Directed [Bi-Directional] Graph=>  A---------B, A connected to B and B connected to A.


* Weighted Graph
  - Division On the basis of weight.
  - Delhi ------- Jaipur

* Completed Graph
  - Every particular node fully connected to each other.
  - Every node id connected to every other node of graph

*Disconnected Graph [Forest Type ]

  A--------B

* Euler Graph
  - Degree of each node is even
  - Degree is no. of connection of each node
  - In-degree and Out Degree -> Topological Sort - > kahn's ALgo
      A------ >B
      ^        ^
      |        | ---> This is Euler Graph
      |_______ C
  -  A = 0 degree
  -  B = 0
  -  C = 2

* Hamiltonian Graph
  - You start from a node, and visit each node in-between only once while traversing.
  - After visited every node for only once, comes to that node, where you started.
  - Of-course you are going to visit the start node for two times only.
  - Making close loop.

* There is not in-built implementation graph.

Famous Methods to implement Graph .

1. Adjacency Matrix
   - 1 is connected to 2
   - Row 'i' is connected to column 'j'
   - i to j

    1 -------------- 2
    |                |
    |                |
    |                |     ====> un-directed Graph
    |                |
    |                |
    4 -------------- 3

    1   2   3   4

1   0   1   0   1

2   1   0   1   0

3   0   1   0   1

4   1   0   1   0


    1 ------------> 2
                    ^
                    |
                    |     ====> directed Graph
                    |
                    |
    4 ------------> 3

    1   2   3   4

1   0   1   0   0

2   0   0   0   0

3   0   1   0   0

4   0   0   1   0

* Limitations of Adjacency Matrix.
  - Node -> 1,2,3,4 then it's easy to maintain in 2-d array with index, i,j
  - But what if Node -> -1, -2, -3, -4
    or Delhi, mumbai, patna , ranchi
    or A, B, C




2. Adjacency List

    1 -------------- 2
    |                |
    |                |
    |                |     ====> un-directed Graph
    |                |
    |                |
    4 -------------- 3


  KEY
  Node -> Neighbours -> Vector/Array

  1 => 2, 4
  2 => 3, 1
  3 => 2, 4
  4 => 3, 1

Generally In question we have edge list,
edge : [ [A,B], [B,C], [C,D], [A,C] ]

Graph => edge list / Ways => READ => Adjacency List

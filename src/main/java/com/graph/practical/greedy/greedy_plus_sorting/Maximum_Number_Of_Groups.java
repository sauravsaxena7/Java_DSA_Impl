/**

 * Maximum Magnets

 Mathew has a collection of magnets, represented by an integer Array A of length X.
 Each element of A corresponds to a magnet, and the value of each element represents
 the magnetic strengths of that magnet (M1, M2, M3 and so on up to Mx)

 He needs divide to these magnets into groups, but there is a catch.

 If the difference between the magnetic strengths of any two magnets is less than Y,
 They will stick together and form an inseparable unit

 Your task is to help Mathew find and return Integer value representing the maximum number
 of magnets that can be added in a single group while ensuring that they do not form inseparable unit
 due to a magnetic strength different less than Y


 Note: There may be multiple groups formed and the maximum number of magnets in any group should be considered

/**
 * Julia has arrived in the Munchkin kingdom of Oz and needs to cross the Golden Brick Road to reach the Wizard's castle.
 * She must navigate the road, which consists of N bricks, each with a value from 0-9. To cross,
 * Julia starts at the first brick and can move to the next, previous, or any brick with the same value.
 * The goal is to find the minimum num
 *
 *
 * It looks like your message was cut off. But based on what you've provided, you're describing a classic shortest path problem on a special graph:
 *
 * Julia starts at index 0.
 *
 * She can move:
 *
 * One step forward (i + 1),
 *
 * One step backward (i - 1),
 *
 * To any other index j such that bricks[i] == bricks[j].
 *
 * The goal is to reach the last brick (index N-1) using the minimum number of moves.
 *
 * This is best solved using Breadth-First Search (BFS).

 *  "01213444444443"
 *
 *   minimum moves = 4
